Existing bug in video card re-ordering

See note in apply-content-ui-video-cards.js, copied below

// Place unmatched pairs at the end of the array
// This will make them the last cards in the DOM, as they will be applied last in applyVideoCards
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24909371/move-item-in-array-to-last-position
//
// This is currently written inaccurately.
// Changing the order of the array while looping through it means not necessarily each entry will be accessed.
